# List of Coronavirus applications

2019-nCov is a current epidemic as of today. Developers around the world are building applications for the public to get up-to-date and accurate information as quickly as possible. With this list we try to compile these applications so that you may see what suits you best. 

If you are a developer, you may also be able to contribute to some of these applications.

Stay safe and remember to wash your hands always.
